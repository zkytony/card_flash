Goal of this project is to create a flashcard application that help
people learning new knowledge, and communicate what they made to drive
the user community.

PHP coding guide: http://pear.php.net/manual/en/standards.php

Plan:
----------
Not UI:

Concern:
- What fundemental features are needed
- How to implement a feature
- How to combine different features together
- Is it easy to improve/modify your code during update
- Tests

Issues on the list:
1. some times the users table's 'deckid' column is not updated/lost
2. the algorithm to ensure id uniqueness needs to be discussed
3, the order of the cards displaying on the card area needs consideration

[1]
Login;
Create Decks; (2 days)
Show cards in a deck in home page; (3 days)
Create and flip cards; (Right now)
 = able to flip the card on the content
 = able to enlarge, and go through the whole deck, no new page needed

[2]
User register
Better manage the data
Share the deck
Self quiz

[3]
Analysis of data
New/Innovative experience
Star system

----------
UI:

Concern:
- How to arrange different parts
- How to display all sorts of things
- User experience
- Other designs related to user's usage (e.g. analysis of user's behaviors)
